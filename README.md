# Clothocalc
Clothoid design support software

## Why make this program ?
Well, that's because for several years now in France, the SETRA and CERTU documents have defined calculation rules concerning road connections, and by integrating the fundamental concept of progressive connection (which brings a safety gain on highspeed roads as well as poor visibility). 

The progressive connection also allows for a gradual transition from straight alignement of the roadway overhang to a circular curve.

The plan survey of bends is done with clothoids, while the longitudinal profile study is done with parabolic connections.
